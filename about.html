		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Glesga Insult Generator was created to honour the everyday threats and insults that are considered unique to Glasgow and its environs. </p>
		<p>Made by a Londoner, this generator is a tribute to my beloved Glesga speaking co-workers â€“ folk who always entertain with their patter.</p>
		<p>Please DM me on <a href "https://twitter.com/MattButler07Twitter">Twitter</a> with any Glesga insults not featured on this site.
		<P><a href="index.html">Back to insults</a></p>
		<p>Thanks to <a href "http://www.insultgenerator.org/">Insult Generator</a> for acting as a source of inspiration for this site, and General Assembly Dash for teaching me how to code.</p>
